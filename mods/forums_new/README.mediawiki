==WARNING==

Due to the design of ATutor’s module system, the module’s name need
to be hard-coded in a lot of places, including:

* The directory name
* module.xml
* module.php (4 occurrences)
* module_delete.php
* module_groups.php (2 occurrences)
* module_news.php

In addition, the directory path is also hard-coded in several places,
including:

* module.php (THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE FILE)
* module_news.php (inside forums_new_news()
or forums_news() when it’s moved back)
* dropdown/posts.inc.php
* and throughout the whole code base

In this partial rewrite the last case in this second list
(i.e., the directory path
being hard-coded throughout the whole code base) is partially mitigated
by moving the hard-coded path to lib/module.inc.php

This means that when this module finally replaces the original forums
module, you will need to make ABSOLUTELY sure that every occurrence of
the module's temporary new name and directory path are replaced with
the standard name and path.

In an “extra” module we use $_module_pages, but in a standard module
we use $this->_pages.

Note that this module uses the same tables as the standard forums module.

==Indentation standards==

All files in this module should adhere to the new ATutor convention of
4 spaces for indentation, except for files that obviously cannot follow
this convention (notably <tt>Makefile</tt>).

For newly created and fixed/modified files, this is explicitly documented
on the first line of the file in the form of a combined vi and emacs mode
line.  If you are using an editor that understands this, your editor will
be automatically configured to use the correct conventions.
